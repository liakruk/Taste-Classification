# Taste-Classification
Abstract—Identifying the taste of chemical molecules plays a
crucial role in taste classification, with important applications
in food safety, pharmaceutical development, and toxicology.
However, performing this task manually is time-consuming and
costly. Our work proposes a machine learning-based framework
to classify molecules as Bitter or Sweet. We also constructed a
molecular descriptor database with SMILES, combining RDKit
and RACs descriptors. These descriptors were used to train
deep neural network (DNN) architectures for faster and more
efficient classification. Two models, Broad and Bottleneck, were
evaluated with 300 executions, each using 10-fold cross-validation
and standard evaluation metrics. The Broad model achieved
the best AUC (95.38%) and overall accuracy (90%), statistically
outperforming the Bottleneck model. Our approach demonstrates
the effectiveness of taste classification by combining structure
and electronic/topological descriptors with neural network-based
prediction.
